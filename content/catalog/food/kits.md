Cookie Decorating Kits
======================
![Gingerbread decorating kit](/img/gbreadkit.jpg " "Gingerbread decorating kit") Hi friends! We offer a gingerbread decorating kit so that you can enjoy decorating cookies with family and friends without all the prep work and clean up. And these cookies will taste a whole lot better than the kit youâ€™d buy at the grocery or craft store. Included in your box: baked gingerbread men, ready-to-use white royal icing, decorating instructions/tips, candy decorations, and delivery (within Durham). $30/dozen cookies, $20/half dozen. Email me at cori@bullseyebakingnc.com if interested. 

*Customization is available.*
